# En-Route ATFM Delay Analysis (2016–2024)

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes **En-Route Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) delays** across Eurocontrol’s network from **2016 to 2024**. Using Python-based data analysis and visualization, it identifies **trends, seasonal patterns, delay causes, and country-level impacts**.

The goal is to better understand **when, where, and why en-route delays occur** and provide insights for operational improvements by Eurocontrol and airlines.

## ✈️ What is ATFM?

**Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM)** is the process of balancing air traffic demand with available capacity to ensure safe and efficient flight operations.
In this context, **en-route ATFM delays** are delays that occur during the airborne phase of a flight due to constraints like ATC capacity, weather, or airspace restrictions.

## 📊 Features

* **Trend & Seasonality Analysis** – Yearly/monthly delay patterns
* **Cause Attribution** – Ranking top delay causes per country and year
* **Visualizations** – Academic-style charts using Matplotlib & Seaborn
* **Predictive Modeling** – Decision Tree, Random Forest models on delay factors
* **Recommendations** – Strategies for delay reduction in Eurocontrol’s airspace

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Excel Dataset** from Eurocontrol (processed under DATA sheet)
